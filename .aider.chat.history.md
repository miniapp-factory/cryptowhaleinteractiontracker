The changes you need to make involve:

1. Updating the app metadata in `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` (title and description).  
2. Creating a new logo generation file `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for it. Once that file is added, I’ll also give you the block to create the new `logo.png.todo` file.

A stylized logo featuring a whale silhouette intertwined with a digital blockchain network. The design shows flowing lines and data points connecting the whale to a series of hexagonal blocks, representing blockchain nodes. The color palette is modern blue and teal tones, with subtle gradients to give depth. The app name “Crypto Whale Interaction Tracker” is subtly integrated into the lower right corner in a clean sans‑serif font, ensuring the logo remains uncluttered and instantly recognizable.
